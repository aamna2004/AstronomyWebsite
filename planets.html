                        comets, and more than a million asteroids.</p>

                        <p>Mercury is the smallest planet in our solar system and the nearest to the Sun.

                            Mercury is only slightly larger than Earth's Moon. Its surface is covered in tens of
                            thousands of impact craters.
                            Despite its proximity to the Sun, Mercury is not the hottest planet in our solar system –
                            that title belongs to nearby
                            Venus, thanks to its dense atmosphere. But Mercury is the fastest planet, zipping around the
                            Sun every 88 Earth days.
                            Mercury is appropriately named for the swiftest of the ancient Roman gods.</p>

                            planet in our solar system.

                            Venus is a cloud-swaddled planet named for a love goddess, and often called Earth’s twin.
                            But pull up a bit closer, and
                            Venus turns hellish. Our nearest planetary neighbor, the second planet from the Sun, has a
                            surface hot enough to melt
                            lead. The atmosphere is so thick that, from the surface, the Sun is just a smear of light.

                            being an ocean world, the only one in the Solar System sustaining liquid surface water.
                            Almost all of Earth's water is
                            contained in its global ocean, covering 70.8% of Earth's crust. The remaining 29.2% of
                            Earth's crust is land, most of
                            which is located in the form of continental landmasses within Earth's land hemisphere.</p>

                            of inhabited entirely by
                            robots.

                            Mars is no place for the faint-hearted. It’s dry, rocky, and bitter cold. The fourth planet
                            from the Sun, Mars, is one
                            of Earth's two closest planetary neighbors (Venus is the other). Mars is one of the easiest
                            planets to spot in the night
                            sky — it looks like a bright red point of light.

                            Despite being inhospitable to humans, robotic explorers — like NASA's Perseverance rover and
                            Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter
                            — serve as pathfinders to eventually get astronauts to the surface of the Red Planet.</p>

                            Jupiter is the largest planet in our solar system. If Jupiter was a hollow shell, 1,000
                            Earths could fit inside. Jupiter
                            also is the oldest planet, forming from the dust and gases left over from the Sun's
                            formation 4.5 billion years ago. But
                            it has the shortest day in the solar system, taking only 10.5 hours to spin around once on
                            its axis.</p>

                            Adorned with a dazzling
                            system of icy rings, Saturn is unique among the planets.

                            Saturn is a massive ball made mostly of hydrogen and helium. The farthest planet from Earth
                            discovered by the unaided
                            human eye, Saturn has been known since ancient times. The planet is named for the Roman god
                            of agriculture and wealth,
                            who was also the father of Jupiter.</p>

                        <p>Uranus is the seventh planet from the Sun, and it's the third largest planet in our solar
                            system – about four times
                            wider than Earth.

                            Uranus is a very cold and windy planet. It is surrounded by faint rings, and more than two
                            dozen small moons as it
                            rotates at a nearly 90-degree angle from the plane of its orbit. This unique tilt makes
                            Uranus appear to spin on its
                            side. Uranus is blue-green in color due to large amounts of methane, which absorbs red light
                            but allows blues to be
                            reflected back into space.</p>

                        <p>Dark, cold and whipped by supersonic winds, giant Neptune is the eighth and most distant
                            major planet orbiting our Sun.

                            More than 30 times as far from the Sun as Earth, Neptune is not visible to the naked eye.
                            The planet’s blue color comes
                            from methane in its atmosphere, which absorbs red wavelengths of light, but allows blue ones
                            to be reflected back into
                            space – very much like its neighbor, Uranus. Neptune was the first planet located using
                            math. German astronomer Johann
                            Galle was the first to observe the planet in 1846. The planet is named after the Roman god
                            of the sea.</p>
