            <!-- Introductory content about Big Bang -->
            <p>The Big Bang is a physical theory describing the expansion of the universe from an initial state of high
                density and temperature. Alexander Friedmann, a physicist in 1922, put forth the notion of the
                universe's expansion the mathematical derivation of his equations named Friedmann equations. A physicist
                named Edwin Hubble published his work of an empirical observation of the notion of an expanding universe
                in early 1929, named Hubble's Law which discerened that galaxies are moving away from Earth at a rate
                that accelerates proportionally with distance. Another physicist name Georges Lemaître proposed his work
                which excluded Friedmann and Hubble's observations. He proposed that the universe emerged from a
                "primeval atom" in 1931, introducing the modern notion of the Big Bang.

            <!-- Content on occurence of Big Bang and the universe -->
            <p>Around 13.7 billion years ago, everything in the universe was compressed into an exceedingly tiny and
                endlessly dense point known as a singularity.
                <br><br>
                The universe then began expanding faster than light in an unexpected and cataclysmic occurrence.
                Physicist Alan Guth's 1980 hypothesis, which transformed our understanding of the Big Bang, led to the
                short phase known as cosmic inflation, lasting around 10^-32 seconds.
                <br><br>
                When cosmic expansion abruptly and mysteriously halted, the universe entered what is often known as the
                Big Bang. During this stage, a process known as "reheating" released a flood of matter and radiation,
                filling the cosmos with particles and atoms—the building blocks for stars, galaxies, and everything we
                see today.

            <!-- Nucleosynthesis and more about big bang -->
            <p>When cosmic expansion ended, its energy was transformed into matter and light, indicating the start of
                the Big Bang. One second later, the universe was a very hot combination of light and particles, with
                temperatures approaching 10 billion degrees Celsius (18 billion degrees Fahrenheit). Protons and
                neutrons collided during the following several minutes during a process known as nucleosynthesis to form
                the first elements: hydrogen, helium, and trace quantities of lithium and beryllium. By five minutes
                after the Big Bang, most of the helium in the universe had produced, but the cosmos's expansion and
                cooling prevented the formation of new elements. At this point, the cosmos was still too hot for atomic
                nuclei to fuse with electrons to create full atoms.The universe was opaque because a large number of
                electrons formed a kind of fog that scattered light.</p>
